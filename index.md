**D&A Effects** is the informal and creative outlet of Daniel Aldrich (Drat) and Tyler Aben, where we explore our passion for crafting unique sound experiences. We design and hand-build boutique sound equipment, showcasing our explorations in high-quality **analog guitar and bass effects (D.R.A.T)**, innovative **digital and modular DSP effects (GlitchCraft)**, and powerful **synth modules (SynthWorks)**. This is a space for fellow sonic experimenters, musicians, and tone enthusiasts to witness our journey. From the warmth of analog circuits to the possibilities of digital manipulation and the power of synthesis â€“ we're excited to share our ongoing sonic creations.

This website serves as a documentation of our creative process and the various projects we're currently developing. You can explore the different facets of our work in more detail [on our projects page](/projects).
