Experimental Sound Engines. Built to Modulate. Designed to Evolve.

**SynthWorks** is the lab where sound is broken down, restructured, and rebuilt from the waveform up. Born from a love of modular and hands-on control, **SynthWorks** delivers tools for sonic architects — synths, modules, and tones that invite you to design, destroy, and reshape your signal path in real time.

This isn’t just synthesis.
This is machined modulation, voltage-driven disruption, and signal design with intention.

From CV-reactive effects to standalone tone generators, every **SynthWorks** unit is hand-crafted for maximum flexibility, playability, and performance. Whether you're deep into Eurorack or just starting to patch together your first system, SynthWorks gives you the custom-components you need to build a sound system that’s uniquely yours — no rules, no limitations.

**Modular**. _Expandable_. **_Unpredictable_**.
This is **SynthWorks**.
