# Drat  
**Pedal Designer • Chaos Tinkerer • Co-Founder of D&A Effects**

I’m **Drat**, and if you trace this whole thing back far enough, it all started with Tyler talking nonstop about modular synths.

At first, I was just listening — curious but on the outside. Then something clicked. The overlap between synth modules and guitar pedals was undeniable, and suddenly I was hooked. I brought up the idea of merging the two worlds, and from there, it became a **joint obsession**.

## Where It All Began

We started experimenting. Building weird circuits. Pushing boundaries. Tyler would prototype synth control modules; I’d tune the audio side for guitar and bass. The line between the two started to blur — and that’s where the magic was.

Eventually, a few musician friends got wind of what we were working on. They wanted to test the gear, use it in their sets, push it to its limits. That feedback loop led to even wilder ideas and new designs. What started in the lab turned into a movement — a **cult following** of artists looking for tones and textures that didn’t exist anywhere else.

## What I Do

- 🎸 **Analog Effects** – Overdrives, Distortions, Fuzzes, and Hybrid Tones.
- 👾 **Digital Effects** – Bit-Crushers, Delays, Reverbs, and more.
- ⚒️ **Circuit + Enclosure Design** – From breadboard to box.
- 🎛 **Hybrid Builds** – Pedals with synth brains and vice versa.
- 🔊 **Live Audio & Demo Testing** – Always trying something new.

## What Drives Me

I build gear for musicians who want to break the mold — people who want their tone to feel alive, unstable, and full of possibility. Every design comes with a little chaos baked in.
