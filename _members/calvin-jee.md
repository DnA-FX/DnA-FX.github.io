# Calvin Jee

A musician at his core, Calvin Jee's journey with music began early. He started playing piano at the age of five, picked up the guitar at ten, and added drums to his repertoire at twenty. For Calvin, music has always been more than just a hobby â€“ it's an integral part of who he is.

His musical tastes are wonderfully diverse, encompassing genres such as:

- Jazz
- Electronic
- Orchestral
- Traditional Folk
- Hip-Hop
- Grunge
- Neo-Soul
- Singer/Songwriter
- Progressive Rock/Metal (his primary focus)

While he has a history of live performances, Calvin finds his true passion in the art of composing. He has a particular affinity for creating soundtracks for games, whether tabletop or video.
