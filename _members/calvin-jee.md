Calvin Jee has been playing piano since he was 5, guitar since he was 10, and drums since he was 20. Music has always been core to his being. he loves a wide range of genres — jazz, electronic, orchestral, traditional folk, hip-hop, grunge, neo-soul, singer/songwriter, _etc_. — but progressive rock/metal is his main domain. he has done many performances in his lifetime, but he prefers the act of composing. He especially loves composing soundtracks for games (tabletop or video). So, if you are making a game and in need of a composer, feel free to reach out (links in the side panel)!
