# Tyler Aben  
**Modular Synth Designer • Sonic Instigator • Co-Founder of D&A Effects**  

I’m **Tyler Aben**, and I guess you could say this whole thing started because I wouldn’t shut up about modular synths.

It began with an idea: **build my own synth modules**. That idea turned into late-night circuit talks with Drat, who got hooked after realizing just how much guitar effects and modular synthesis had in common. We both saw the potential for something different — a space where analog and digital could twist together in unexpected ways.

## From Spark to Circuit

What started as a few breadboarded prototypes quickly became something bigger. Together, we began designing **hybrid circuits**, **glitchy tone machines**, and **experimental audio tools**. The gear wasn’t just functional — it was fun, unpredictable, and deeply personal.

As word spread, friends in live music and production started trying out our creations. One thing led to another, and a **cult following** started to grow — one that craved that same spirit of sonic exploration.

## What I Do

- 🎛 **Modular Synth Modules** – Utility meets chaos in every patch.
- ⚙️ **Analog Experiments** – Oscillation, time-bending, modulation, and control.
- 🎚 **Hybrid Projects** – Where synth and stompbox logic merge.
- 🔊 **Sound Design + Music** – Always exploring new textures.
