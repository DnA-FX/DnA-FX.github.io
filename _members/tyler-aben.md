# Tyler Aben

**Modular Synth Designer • Sonic Instigator • D&A Effects Collaborator**

I'm **Tyler Aben**, and you could say my obsession with modular synths is what sparked this whole **D&A Effects** adventure.

It all started with a simple, persistent idea: _"I wanted to fix and build my own synth modules."_ 
That idea led to late-night circuit discussions with my friend [Drat (Daniel Aldrich)](/members/drat), who, much to my surprise, became fascinated by the unexpected connections between guitar effects and modular synthesis. We quickly realized the potential to create something truly unique - a space where analog and digital sounds could intertwine and evolve in exciting ways.

## From Initial Spark to Tangible Circuit

What began as a few experiments on breadboards rapidly grew into a collaborative journey. Together, we embarked on designing **innovative hybrid circuits**, **glitch-inducing tone machines**, and **experimental audio tools**. The gear we created wasn't just functional; it was inspiring, unpredictable, and reflected our shared passion for sound exploration.

## My Sonic Contributions

Here's a glimpse into my primary areas of focus within D&A Effects:

- **Modular Synth Modules:** Crafting versatile modules where utility meets sonic chaos.
- **Analog Circuit Design:** Exploring the art of oscillation, time-bending, modulation, and creative control.
- **Hybrid Project Development:** Merging the logic of synths and stompboxes to create new sonic possibilities.
- **Sound Design & Music Creation:** Continuously searching for unique sonic textures and pushing creative boundaries.
