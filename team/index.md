## Who We Are

**D&A Effects** (a.k.a. **DnA-FX**) is a boutique pedal and sound design lab founded by **Drat** in full collaboration with synth designer & audio specialist **Tyler Aben**. We're creators, hackers, and musicians engineering the next wave of analog and digital effects.

## Musicians and Artists
And where would we be without the love and support from those who choose to use the equipment that we have designed? While we wish that we could list everyone who has helped us along our path, that would make this list truly un-ending. So here are some of the more notable of those who have offered us their continued support, input, and dedication.
