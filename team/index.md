## Who We Are

**D&A Effects** (a.k.a. **DnA-FX**) is project to develop our own boutique pedals and experiment in our sound design _lab_ brought together by Daniel Aldrich (a.k.a. **Drat**) in full collaboration with backyard synth designer & amateur audio connoisseur **Tyler Aben**. We're creators, hackers, and musicians.

## The Mission

To merge engineering precision with experimental sound â€” creating pedals/mods that are not just tools, but instruments in their own right. Whether we're chasing a vintage warmth or glitchy chaos, we build the tools that let us **customize our sonic DnA.**

## Our Sub-Projects

- [**D.R.A.T.**](/drat-pedals): **D**rat: **R**edesigning **A**nalog **T**ones houses all of our **analog** guitar and bass effects.
- [**GlitchCraft**](/glitchcraft-pedals): GlitchCraft is where all our **digital** and DSP effects are housed.
- [**SynthWorks**](/synthworks-mods): **Synth**-focused tools and modules.
- [**Gene-Splice**](/gene-splice-collabs): A **collab**oration project, exploring experimental audio mutations.

## Musicians and Artists
And where would we be without the love and support from those who choose to use the equipment that we have designed? While we wish that we could list everyone who has helped us along our path, that would make this list truly un-ending. So here are some of the more notable of those who have offered us their continued support, input, and dedication.
