Have a question? Want to place an order? Just want to talk tone?

We’d love to hear from you.

At **D&A Effects**, we operate a little differently. Every pedal is handcrafted in small batches, and we handle all orders _directly through email_. This lets us keep things personal, answer your questions one-on-one, and make sure you’re getting exactly what you need — no middlemen, no generic checkout pages.

##🎛️ Ready to Order?
Shoot us an email at [orders@dna-fx.ca](orders@dna-fx.com) with:

- The pedal(s) you’re interested in
- Any questions or custom requests
- Your shipping location (just for a quick quote)

We'll get back to you as soon as we can with availability, lead times, and payment info.

##📩 General Inquiries
Have feedback, collab ideas, or just wanna nerd out about gear?
Hit us up at [info@dna-fx.ca](info@dna-fx.ca)

We’re a small team building equipment because we love it — and that means your message actually matters to us. No auto-responders, no ticket queues. Just real humans making weird, wonderful sounds with you.
