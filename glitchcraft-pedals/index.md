**GlitchCraft** is where our digital sound lab meets precision engineering. Born from the same minds behind [**D.R.A.T.**](drat-pedals), **GlitchCraft** dives deep into the world of glitched-out distortion, unstable delays, and otherworldly textures — effects that embrace the unexpected and push boundaries.

This isn’t clean. This isn’t sterile.
This is corrupted code, rewired reality, and tonal mutation in pedal form.

Each **GlitchCraft** effect is a controlled experiment in digital signal programming — handcrafted algorithms, warped LFOs, fractured reverbs, and unpredictable feedback loops. They're made for those who don't just play — they bend sound to their will.

Whether you're shaping cinematic swells, conjuring bit-crushed doom, or dialing into cybernetic dissonance, **GlitchCraft** gives you the tools to reshape your sonic DnA.
