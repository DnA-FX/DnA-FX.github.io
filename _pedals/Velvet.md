## Project: Velvet Fuzz - Smooth Sustain

This project aims to create a fuzz pedal with a smooth, almost singing sustain and a vintage-inspired tonal character.

### Development Focus:

- Careful transistor biasing for a warm and even fuzz tone.
- A tone control that allows for subtle shaping of the fuzz's character.
- A focus on sustain and note clarity.

### Potential Features:

- "Texture" control to adjust the smoothness or grit of the fuzz.
- "Bloom" control to influence the sustain and decay.

### Requirements:
- Power: 9V DC Center Negative
- Current Draw: Estimated <10mA
- Input Impedance: 100k立
- Output Impedance: 10k立

### Updates:
