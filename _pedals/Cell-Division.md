## Project: Cell-Division Chorus - Deep Modulation

The goal of this project is to create a chorus effect with a deep and pronounced swirling character, adding a thick and watery texture to the sound.

### Development Focus:

- Utilizing multiple delay lines for a richer and more complex modulation.
- An LFO with a wide sweep for a pronounced swirling effect.
- A mix control to blend the dry and wet signals.

### Potential Features:

- Depth and Rate controls for intensity and speed.
- "Voice" control to adjust the number of delay lines or the complexity of the modulation.

### Requirements:
- Power: 9V DC Center Negative
- Current Draw: Estimated <70mA
- Input Impedance: 1M立
- Output Impedance: 1k立
