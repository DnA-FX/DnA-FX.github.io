Experimental Sound Engines. Built to Modulate. Designed to Evolve.

**SynthWorks** is the sub-project that ignited our entire creative journey. Born from a fascination with modular synthesis and the power of hands-on control, **SynthWorks** is where we explore the fundamental building blocks of sound. It's our way of providing tools for fellow sonic architects - innovative synths, versatile modules, and inspiring tones that invite us to design, disrupt, and completely reshape our signal paths in real time.

This is more than just synthesis; it's about the art of sonic construction.
It's about machined modulation, voltage-driven experimentation, and intentional signal design.

From CV-reactive effects inspired by our pedal explorations to standalone sound generators pushing sonic boundaries, every **SynthWorks** unit is hand-crafted with a focus on maximum flexibility, intuitive playability, and inspiring performance. Whether we're deeply immersed in the Eurorack ecosystem or just beginning to patch our first modular system, **SynthWorks** aims to provide the unique custom-components needed to build a sound system that’s truly your own - free from rigid structures and full of sonic possibilities.

**Modular**. _Expandable_. **_Unpredictable_**.
This is **SynthWorks** – the foundation of our sound explorations.
