{% content text %}
**Gene-Splice** is a project rooted in experimentation — a series of hybrid audio machines built by cross-breeding ideas, formats, and technologies. Analog, digital, modular, and everything in between: if it sparks curiosity and bends expectations, it belongs here.

These devices aren’t confined by tradition. They’re _spliced_ together in the lab, designed to disrupt categories and _evolve_ with your sound.

## Why Gene-Splice?
Because some ideas don't fit inside one category; some circuits are discovered, not designed; the most interesting things happen at the edges of compatibility; hybrid gear deserves a home. **Gene-Splice** is where form meets function, and circuits _evolve_ — not by iteration, but by _mutation_.
