**GlitchCraft** is the sub-project where our digital sound lab meets precision design. Born from the same minds behind [**DRAT**](/projects/drat), **GlitchCraft** dives deep into the world of glitched-out distortion, unstable delays, and otherworldly textures — effects that embrace the unexpected and push boundaries.

This isn’t clean. This isn’t sterile.
This is corrupted code, rewired reality, and tonal mutation in pedal form.

Each **GlitchCraft** effect is a controlled experiment in digital signal programming — handcrafted algorithms, warped LFOs, fractured reverbs, and unpredictable feedback loops. They're made for those who don't just play — they bend sound to their will.

Whether we're shaping cinematic swells, conjuring bit-crushed doom, or dialing into cybernetic dissonance, **GlitchCraft** gives us the tools to reshape our sonic DnA.
