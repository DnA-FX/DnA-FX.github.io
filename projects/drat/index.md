<!--**D**esigned for **R**aw **A**nalog **T**one-->
**D**rat: **R**edesigning **A**nalog **T**ones
 — this is the project that started it all. Born from a simple but relentless idea: to make **high-quality** analog pedals without compromising on tone, craft, or soul.

We grew tired of the flat, uninspired sounds of mass-produced gear — pedals that felt more like plastic than passion. So we set out to do it differently.

The  **D.R.A.T.** sub-project focuses on capturing the tones players chase: gritty overdrives, lush modulations, fat fuzzes, and everything in between. Every pedal begins with a sound worth obsessing over — and ends with a piece of gear built by hand, tested by ear, and made to inspire.

Each unit is meticulously assembled, rigorously tested, and held to a personal standard of excellence — not to just function properly, but to feel right. This isn't just about circuits. It's about character. It's about tone that’s raw, real, and ours.
