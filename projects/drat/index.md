**D**rat: **R**edesigning **A**nalog **T**ones
 - this is the parallel project that was born from our journey into sound. Driven by a simple yet unwavering desire: to explore and craft **high-quality** analog pedals with uncompromising tone, meticulous construction, and a whole lot of soul.

Like many players, we also noticed the increasingly high cost of boutique and even some mass-produced guitar effects. Frustrated by both the often sterile sounds of some readily available options and the prohibitive prices of others, we decided to take matters into our own hands. In our spare time, we set out to build something different, something truly our own that wouldn't break the bank for the quality offered.

The **D.R.A.T** sub-project is our exploration into the heart of classic guitar and bass tones: the rich sustain of gritty overdrives, the swirling textures of lush modulations, the thick and woolly character of fat fuzzes, and all the inspiring sonic territories in between. Each pedal concept begins with a sound that captivates us - and evolves into a piece of gear built by our hands, tested by our ears, and designed to ignite creativity.

Every unit we create is carefully assembled, rigorously tested, and held to our personal standard of sonic excellence - not just to function, but to *feel* right. For us, it's more than just circuits; it's about imbuing each creation with character, with a tone thatâ€™s raw, real, and undeniably ours.
