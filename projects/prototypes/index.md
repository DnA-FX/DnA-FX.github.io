{% capture text %}
Welcome to the **Prototypes** corner of the lab - our sonic sandbox where ideas take their first tangible form. This is where circuits are breadboarded, concepts are tested, and the sometimes messy but always exciting process of bringing a new sound to life begins. Prototypes are the crucial first step in the evolution of every **D&A Effects** creation, allowing us to experiment freely and refine our designs before committing to a final build.

## The Genesis of Sound: From Idea to Prototype

Every pedal, every module starts as an idea - a spark of inspiration, a desire for a specific tone, or a curiosity to explore a new sonic territory. The prototyping phase is where these abstract concepts begin to take shape. We might start with a circuit schematic, adapt existing designs, or even stumble upon happy accidents on the breadboard.

This stage is all about experimentation and learning. We try different component combinations, tweak values, and listen intently to how these changes affect the sound. Not every prototype will see the light of day as a final product, but each one provides valuable insights and helps us hone our craft. It's a process of trial and error, fueled by curiosity and a relentless pursuit of unique and inspiring sounds.

**As a prototype evolves and progresses towards a finalized design, you can expect to find it moved to its own dedicated page under the appropriate project (_e.g._, D.R.A.T., GlitchCraft, SynthWorks, or Gene-Splice). This Prototypes page will primarily showcase our works-in-progress and early-stage explorations.**
